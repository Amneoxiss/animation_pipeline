# Animation_pipeline

Beginning of an animation pipeline for maya
I've started it for my final year movie, it includes many fonctionnalities like, basic import-export-reference with auto namespace, automated scene creation, playblast, alembic batch export, relink shader between lookdev scene and lighting...

For now it needs a specific nomenclature to work, but I want to make it as universal as possible in the end.

# ACTUAL REFACTORING Q4 2022
The unamed animation pipeline, become : VULCAIN.
Building new code to create a more flexible pipeline.
Include possibility for other dcc and rendering Engine than maya/Arnold.
