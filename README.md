# Animation_pipeline

Beginning of an animation pipeline for maya
I've started it for my final year movie, it includes many fonctionnalities like, basic import-export-reference with auto namespace, automated scene creation, playblast, alembic batch export, relink shader between lookdev scene and lighting...

For now it needs a specific nomenclature to work, but I want to make it at universal as posible in the end.
